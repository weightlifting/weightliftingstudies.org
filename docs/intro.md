# Introduction

Setting the baseUrl to /weightliftingstudies.org/ makes it work on the https://weightlifting.github.io/weightliftingstudies.org/ URL, but gives a 404 error on the weightliftingstudies.org URL. It also makes it break on the local instance (localhost:3000). What happens when I set the baseUrl to '/'?
